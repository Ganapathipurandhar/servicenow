# Table Creation and Management in ServiceNow (or Similar Platform)

This document summarizes the key points discussed during the session on table creation, customization, and management.

---

## 1. **Table Creation and Customization**
- **Creating a New Table**:
  - A new table (e.g., "Apple 15") can be created with a **label name** (user-friendly name) and a **backend name** (system-generated name, often starting with an underscore `_` for custom tables).
- **Autogenerated Fields**:
  - Six fields are automatically generated when a new table is created:
    - `CID` (Globally Unique Identifier)
    - `Created`
    - `Created By`
    - `Updated`
    - `Updated By`
    - `Updates`
- **Custom Fields**:
  - Custom fields like `Name`, `Address`, and `Mobile Number` can be added to the table. Field types (e.g., string) and lengths can be configured.

---

## 2. **Form Layout and Records**
- **Form Layout**:
  - The form layout can be configured by moving fields between available and selected sections to customize the user interface.
- **Creating Records**:
  - Records can be created by entering data (e.g., `Name`, `Address`, `Mobile Number`) and saving them.
- **List Layout**:
  - The list layout can be configured to display specific fields (e.g., `Created`, `Created By`, `Updated`, `Updated By`) and view records.

---

## 3. **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**
- **Autogenerated ACLs**:
  - Four ACLs are automatically generated when a table is created:
    - **Read**
    - **Write**
    - **Delete**
    - **Create**
  - These ACLs control who can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the table.

---

## 4. **Extensible Tables**
- **Parent and Child Tables**:
  - A **child table** can inherit fields from a **parent table**. For example:
    - Parent Table: `developers`
    - Child Table: ` senior developers`
  - The child table inherits all fields from the parent table, along with the six autogenerated fields.

---

## 5. **Auto Numbering**
- **Auto Numbering**:
  - Auto-numbering generates a unique identifier for each record (e.g., `APR0001001`).
  - The prefix, padding, and number of digits can be configured.

---

## 6. **Deleting and Restoring Records**
- **Deleting Records**:
  - Records can be deleted from a table (e.g., from the `Incident` table). Deleted records are stored in the `Audit Delete` table.
- **Restoring Records**:
  - Deleted records can be restored using the `Undelete` functionality, which is available for up to 28 days after deletion.

---

## 7. **Table Controls**
- **Extensible Checkbox**:
  - The **extensible** checkbox in table controls allows other tables to extend the current table.
- **Other Controls**:
  - Other controls include **Live Feed**, **Auto Numbering**, and **Application Access**.

---

## 8. **Practical Example**
- A new table (`developers`) was created as a child of `senior developers`. It inherited fields from the parent table.
- Records were created in both the parent and child tables to demonstrate their relationship.

---

## 9. **Questions and Clarifications**
- Key questions addressed during the session:
  - How to restore deleted records.
  - The difference between parent and child tables.
  - How auto-numbering works and how to configure it.

---

## 10. **Next Steps**
- Advanced topics like roles, groups, and further customization of forms and tables will be covered in future sessions.

---

### Key Takeaways:
- **Tables** are fundamental building blocks in the system.
- **Extensible tables** allow for inheritance between parent and child tables.
- **Auto Numbering** and **ACLs** are essential for managing records and controlling access.
- **Deleting and Restoring Records** is a useful feature for recovering accidentally deleted data.
